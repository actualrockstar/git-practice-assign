#Git Practice Assignment

The article I found is [here]("https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21121275/augmented-virtual-reality-hiring-software-engineers-hired")

The article talks about how AR/VR software engineering jobs are rising in demand.Big techcompanies like Google and Facebook are interested in exploring he uses of VR and AR and in turn are hiring more engineers. I thought this was interesting because they mentioned that Facebook has 3000 listings for AR/VR related positions. The field fascinates me because it seeks to make tech and screens and even greater part of our lives. As a student who wants a job when I graduate, this is great news, butVR/AR also scares me in a way. The potential of it is unending so only time will tell if it's a good investment. I think, though, that VR/AR is super powerful and, if developed mindfully, can do some even greater things than we've already seen.
